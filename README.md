### DOTFILES
Welcome to my own little world of dotfiles! Here, you will find my customizations that I've been through (and still am to this day and moving forward). These configurations can be used as a template from which you can add your own custom stuff.

### Installation
To install the required software and the configurations, we use [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com). To set it up, I personally use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
```
cd playbooks
ansible-playbook -l localhost
```
